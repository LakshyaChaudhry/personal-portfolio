# Hello World

This is my first blog post. I built this blog using **MDX** with Vite's build-time compilation.

## Why MDX?

MDX lets me write content in Markdown while embedding React components when needed. Posts are just files in the repo. No CMS, no database, no external service. Write markdown, push to git, done.

## The Stack

- **Vite** compiles MDX to React components at build time via `@mdx-js/rollup`
- **React Router** handles `/blog` and `/blog/:slug` routing
- **Tailwind CSS** styles everything with custom prose classes
- **Vercel** auto-deploys on push

## What's Next

More posts coming soon about builds I complete.
